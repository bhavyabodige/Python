# Leap Year : This program is to check if a given year is a Leap year or not.
              A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, unless it is a century year (eg. 1900, 2000, etc) when it is a leap year only if the year is evenly divisible by 400
              The second part of the rule effects century years
